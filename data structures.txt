- Sets (contains, add, remove)
- Min/Max Heap (organize data so that getting largest item is O(1). Heaping is O(n) operation)
- Heapsort algorithm (grab largest object each time, O(n^2))
- Priority Queue (based on heapsort)
- Quick Sort algorithm (divide and conquer)
- Minimum, maximum of a set (in O(n))
- Retrieve n-th largest/smallest element (like quicksort, but only half processing)
- Hashtable (using hashing to derive storing index)
- Binary Search Tree (fast search in O(h))
- Red-Black trees (balanced, to guarantee O(h) worst case)
- Longest common subsequence algorithm (DP)
[...]
- Graphs (DFS, BFS, topological sort, strongly connected components)
- Minimum spanning trees (to cover a graph)
